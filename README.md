# Module 1 Assignment Project – Singapore Jobs Analytics

Design a simple data product (dashboard or web app) using a real-world CSV of Singapore job postings (~1M+ rows). Your goal is to solve a clear business problem for a specific user group using insights from the data.

---

## 1. Business Case (2–3 bullets)

Briefly describe:

- Business scenario (e.g. talent acquisition, policy analyst, career coach).
- **Objective**: What decision/problem are you helping to address?
- Target users and value: How will this dashboard/app help them?

> Example: “Help a talent acquisition team identify which roles and skills are most in demand so they can prioritise hiring and sourcing.”

---

## 2. Data Handling & Process (5–8 bullets)

Summarise your end-to-end process:

- Tools used (e.g. Python + Pandas / DuckDB / SQL).
- How you loaded the CSV (~1M+ rows).
- Key cleaning steps (missing values, standardising categories, parsing dates, handling salary formats).
- Important feature engineering (e.g. seniority, salary bands, demand metrics, skill tags).
- EDA highlights: key patterns or anomalies you discovered that shaped your dashboard design.

You do not need to show all code, but the logic and key decisions should be clear.

---

## 3. Dashboard / App (6–10 bullets)

Describe and demonstrate your solution:

- Type of solution: dashboard (e.g. Streamlit, Power BI, Tableau) or simple web app.
- Main views:
  - Overview metrics (e.g. total postings, top roles/industries, salary ranges).
  - Drill-down view (by role, industry, location, skills, etc.).
  - Time trend view (e.g. postings over time, salary trends).
- Interactivity: filters, sorting, drill-downs, tooltips where relevant.
- Design choices: layout, chart types, colour scheme, readability.
- How each view directly supports your business objective and target users.

Include 2–4 key screenshots in your written submission (or show live in the presentation).

## 4. Presentation (10 mins per team)

Suggested flow:

1. **Business case & objective** (2–3 mins)  
   - Scenario, users, objective, success criteria.
2. **Process & data handling** (3–4 mins)  
   - How you cleaned, transformed, and explored the data.
3. **Dashboard / app walkthrough** (3–4 mins)  
   - Main views, interactions, and how they answer the business question.
4. **Challenges & learnings** (1–2 mins)  
   - Technical/analytical challenges, what you learned, and possible next steps.

---

## 5. Deliverables

- Brief written report (Markdown/PDF) following Sections 1–4 above.
- Working dashboard / app (deployed link or clear run instructions).
- Code repo with:
  - Data handling notebook(s) / scripts,
  - Dashboard/app code,
  - README with setup steps.

Focus on a **coherent story** from business question → data process → dashboard → insights, rather than advanced techniques.
